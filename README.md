# Mint Chocolate Chip
A modpack that focuses on exploration, magic and cooking, with a little bit of tech to construct explosive weaponry.

There is an in-game guidebook with some beginner's tips on things the player should be aware of, as well as a summary of most of the big or notable mods in the pack. Beyond that, the end goal is completely up to the player.

Made as a modpack for friends, so don't expect frequent updates or support.
